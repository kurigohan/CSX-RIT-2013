Question 1:
  What is the imbalance measurement value for the "simple" string
  hash function? 17 (using words.txt)

Question 2: 
  What is the imbalance value for your custom hash function? 1 (using words.txt)


Question 3: 
How do different hashing functions affect the number of
times that the hash table must resize? 

Efficient hashing functions will need to resize more often than inefficient hashing functions. Efficient hashing functions produce less collisions which means smaller chains. As a result, more buckets will be filled, hence the load factor will increase faster.
