<h1 align="center">Computer Science for Transfers <br>Lab - Activity 1</h1>

<p>In this activity you will use Java to write a program that creates and
displays the screen shown in the picture below:
</p>

<p>The GUI that your program will display does not have to be programmed
to respond to any user input (i.e. the buttons and text
fields will be inactive).&nbsp;  The purpose of a program such as this is to
provide the programmer, or the user, with an opportunity to see what the
GUI that a software system might produce will look like.&nbsp;  In this case,
this program will provide you with an opportunity to learn how to
use the containers, components, and layout managers provided by the Java
Swing classes.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>If you are not sure which Swing components to use in this program, run
the Java Swing demo by typing the following command:
</p>

<p></p><center><tt>swingset</tt></center><p></p>

<p>The Swing demo will create a GUI that contains all of the components
that can be created using Swing.
</p>

<p>Name your program:  <tt>AddressScreen.java</tt>.&nbsp;
The program takes no command line arguments and will simply create a 
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JFrame.html"><tt>JFrame</tt></a>
and place the appropriate components inside the frame.&nbsp;
It is not necessary to write the code required to terminate
your program correctly.&nbsp;  When you are finished running the program
simply use the interrupt (<tt>control-c</tt> or <tt>Del</tt>) key to 
terminate it.
</p>

<p>Once you are convinced that your program is working correctly, and
that the GUI is formatted correctly, submit your work using the following 
command:</p>

<p></p><center><tt>try csx-grd lab13-1 AddressScreen.java</tt></center><p></p>

<p>
   <strong>Note:</strong> It is usually considered "good style" to create the
   contents of a window object within its constructor, rather than writing
   a <code>main()</code> that creates a window and then populates it "from
   the outside" (as it were).  You should take this into account while
   writing your solutions to the various parts of this lab.
