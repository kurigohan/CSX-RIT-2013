<h1 align="center">Computer Science for Transfers <br>Lab - Activity 2</h1>

<p>In this activity write a program named, <tt>ScramblePad.java</tt>, that
will create a GUI similar to the one displayed below:
</p>

<p></p><center><img src="Computer%20Science%20for%20Transfers%20Lab%20-%20Activity%202_files/scramble.gif"></center><p></p>

<p>Be sure to pay close attention to the colors used in the GUI.&nbsp;
Your program must create a GUI that uses the same colors and the same layout
used in the image above.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>As in the previous activity your GUI does not have to be active (i.e.
the buttons contained in the GUI do not need to work).&nbsp;  You simply have
to write a program that creates a GUI similar to the one shown above.&nbsp;  
Your program does not need to terminate correctly, you can use the <tt>Del</tt>
or the <tt>control-c</tt> key to terminate the program.
</p>

<p>Once you are convinced that your program is working correctly, submit it
using the following command:</p>
