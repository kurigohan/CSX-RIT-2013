<p>The frames that you created in the previous programs are not the only type
of displays used in programs that utilize a graphical user interface.&nbsp;
Many times, as a program runs, information will be collected from the user
using a dialog.&nbsp;  Dialogs are typically modal, which means that no
other work can be done in the program until the user dismisses the dialog.
</p>

<p>Swing provides the programmer with the ability to create several different
types of dialogs.&nbsp; For example, an instance of the
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JFileChooser.html"><tt>JFileChooser</tt></a>
class provides the user with the ability to select a file that can be used
in a program.&nbsp;  Other dialogs can be used to provide the user with
diagnostic information and confirm user selections.&nbsp; The static methods
contained in the
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JOptionPane.html"><tt>JOptionPane</tt></a>
class can be used to create a wide variety of dialogs that can be used in
a program.&nbsp;  Take a few minutes to look over the documentation for the
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JFileChooser.html"><tt>JFileChooser</tt></a>
and
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JOptionPane.html"><tt>JOptionPane</tt></a>
classes before proceeding to the next step.
</p>

<p>Write a program named, <tt>DialogViewer</tt>, that takes a single command
argument.&nbsp;  The command line argument will be used by the program to
determine what type of dialog to display.&nbsp;  The three valid command
line arguments are specified in the table below:
</p>

<div align="center"><center>

<table border="1" width="72%">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="28%"><strong>Command Line Argument</strong></td>
    <td width="72%"><strong>Action</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="28%"><center>f</center></td>
    <td width="72%">Display an instance of a 
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JFileChooser.html"><tt>JFileChooser</tt></a>.&nbsp;
If the user selects a file, the program will print the name of
the file selected by the user.&nbsp; If the user did not select a file an
appropriate message should be printed by the program.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="28%"><center>c</center></td>
    <td width="72%">Display a confirm dialog that contains the message
"Are you sure?".&nbsp; After the dialog has been dismissed, display the 
type of button (i.e. Yes, No, or Cancel) that the user pressed to dismiss 
the dialog.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="28%"><center>m</center></td>
    <td width="72%">Display a message dialog box.&nbsp; The message
displayed in the box should be your name.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</center></div>

<p>You will notice that both the
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JFileChooser.html"><tt>JFileChooser</tt></a>
and
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JOptionPane.html"><tt>JOptionPane</tt></a>
classes provide a number of different methods that you can use to create
the dialogs needed in this program.&nbsp;  In this activity, always use the
method that requires the fewest number of parameters.&nbsp; For example,
when you write the code to create the
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JFileChooser.html"><tt>JFileChooser</tt></a>
use the default constructor.&nbsp; Finally you will notice that the
static methods in the
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JOptionPane.html"><tt>JOptionPane</tt></a>
class, that you will use to create the confirm dialog and the message dialog,
require a
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/usr/local/jdk/docs/api/javax/swing/JFrame.html"><tt>JFrame</tt></a>
as a parameter. &nbsp; If you read the documentation carefully, you will notice
that you can pass a null object as that parameter. 
</p>
<p>If the program is not invoked correctly, an appropriate usage message
should be displayed on standard error.&nbsp; Since this program utilizes
the AWT, a thread will be created when you display the dialogs.&nbsp;
Since a Java program does not terminate until all of the threads within
the program have terminated, you will have to use <tt>System.exit( 0 )</tt>
to terminate your program.
</p>

<p>Once you are convinced that the program is working correctly, submit it
using the following command:</p>

<p></p><center><tt>try csx-grd lab13-3 DialogViewer.java</tt></center><p></p>
