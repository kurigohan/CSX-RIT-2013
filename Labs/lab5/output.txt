To where it bent in the undergrowth; 
Then took the other, as just as fair, 
And having perhaps the better claim, 
Though as for that, the passing there 
Had worn them really about the same, 
Oh, I kept the first for another day! 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference.
