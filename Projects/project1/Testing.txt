Board.java Testing
=======================
Created a seperate class for testing Board methods called TestBoard. Each time I added a new method to the 
Board class I created a new method or added statements to the main method in the TestBoard class to test it. 

Made a dozen different input.txt files to test possible scenarios such as extra spaces or invalid characters. 

Command.java
=======================
Executed the commands used in the output example from the Project 1 specification page and compared my output to 
the example output. 


Cell.java, WaterCell.java, ShipCell.java, Ship.java
=======================
Simulated fire commands by calling hit methods manually and then viewed the results.

Battleship.java
=======================
Since the Battleship class only contains the main method and prompt method, I tested Battleship by playing the game
and checking for proper behavior from all the classes it uses.

Error Cases Tested:
 - invalid size argument
 - out of range size argument ( size > 26 && size < 5)

 - overlapping coordinates in text file

 Game commands:
